## 📚 Description

Welcome to the **CSS Advanced** project! This is a continuation of the previous **HTML, advanced** project. Here, we dive deeper into the power of **CSS** to bring life and style to static web pages.

You will explore:
- CSS selectors and specificity
- Box model properties
- Styling rules
- How browsers render styles
- Inline styles, classes, and much more!

The ultimate goal? Create beautifully styled pages, just like a real frontend developer. 🧑‍🎨
